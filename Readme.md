## Description
Wake & Game is a newly innovative application that brings more interaction to a user's alarm clock. In this application not only can the user create alarms to warn them of awaking from sleep, but upon those alarms going off there are requirements before the alarm stops sounding. The user must physically interact for a period of time with the embedded games that store data locally. This forces the user to not constantly hit snooze and interact with something physically and mentally, causing their brain to begin more intense functionality to get ready for the day.
